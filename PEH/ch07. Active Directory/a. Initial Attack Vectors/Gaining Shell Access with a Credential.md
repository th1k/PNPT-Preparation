Attempting to gain a shell, the victim machine windows security picks it up.
How can we evade this?

6. Try psexec.py by itself without Metasploit

Remember to put the password in â€˜...' since I have a "!"

This works for us to gain a shell but there are other options as well:
- smbexec.py
- wmiexec.py

## Notes:
- start with smbexec or wmiexec
- psexec is very noisy
- start as quiet as possible
