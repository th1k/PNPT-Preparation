# Pivoting

## Pivoting Lab Set Up

- Check https://academy.tcm-sec.com/courses/1152300/lectures/24781516
- basically creating a network that is only accessible via one of the machines (ie. you can only access the Earth Machine thru the Vegeta Machine)

> I do not feel like rebuilding this lab in virtual box YET lol
> If using VMWare Player then you can't really set up the pivoting lab since you can't edit virtual network settings
